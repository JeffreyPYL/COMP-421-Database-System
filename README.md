# COMP-421-Database-System
This repository is for the work done within the Database System class
In this class I learn Database Design: conceptual design of databases (e.g., entity-relationship model), relational data model, functional dependencies. Database Manipulation: relational algebra, SQL, database application programming, triggers, access control. Database Implementation: transactions, concurrency control, recovery, query execution and query optimization. 

These are some codes for different assignments and a final projects which I build and design a store database.
